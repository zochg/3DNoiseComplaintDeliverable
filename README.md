Deliverable for Lab06: 3D Mapping

3D maps can help to symbolize data whose scale is better shown visually, in the Z dimension, versus a simple 2D color ramp which would show different proportionalities. However, a 2D map shows data better that is spatially different, rather than different in a Z dimension. For example, if you wanted to illustrate the incidence rates of tornados in a state, you could have the size of the bar in the vertical dimension represent frequency of tornadoes recorded per county. However, if you wanted to show the (historic) dispersal of tornadoes over the whole United States, and not frequency, you would be better served using a 2D map which shows the spatial distribution of tornadoes in the country, rather than just at a State level.
